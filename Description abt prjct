# Arduino Smart Car with Obstacle Detection 🚗🔊

This project demonstrates an Arduino-based car system that can be controlled using serial commands.  
The car moves **forward, backward, or stops** based on the input received from the Serial Monitor.  
Additionally, it uses an **ultrasonic sensor** to detect obstacles within 100 cm. If an obstacle is detected,  
the motors stop and a **buzzer alarm** is triggered, while a message is displayed on the LCD.

## ✨ Features
- Control car using Serial commands:
  - `forward` → Moves car forward
  - `backward` → Moves car backward
  - `stop` → Stops the car
- **Ultrasonic sensor** detects obstacles within 100 cm
- **Buzzer alert** when obstacle is detected
- **16x2 I2C LCD** for status messages (moving forward, backward, stopped, obstacle detected)

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- DC Motors with L298N Motor Driver
- 16x2 I2C LCD
- Buzzer
- Wires, Breadboard, Power supply

## 📜 How it Works
1. Open the Arduino Serial Monitor and enter commands (`forward`, `backward`, `stop`).
2. The car will move in the desired direction using DC motors.
3. Ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance.
4. If an obstacle is detected within 100 cm:
   - Motors stop immediately
   - Buzzer sounds
   - LCD displays "OBSTACLE HERE!!"

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add Bluetooth or Wi-Fi control instead of Serial Monitor.
- Use sensors for automatic obstacle avoidance.
- Add camera module for vision-based navigation.
